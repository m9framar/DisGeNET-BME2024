## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a graph neural network for predicting disease-gene associations. Working with DisGeNET, a comprehensive database of these associations, we apply deep learning to an important challenge of bioinformatics.

## Dataset

[DisGeNET](https://www.disgenet.org/)

### The DISGENET schema

DISGENET data is standardized using community-supported standards and ontologies. The data can be filtered and selected by using different attributes, metrics and scores available for the genes, variants, diseases and their associations.
